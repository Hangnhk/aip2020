# Some other ideas...

- Have react perform live updates of the converted value on every change, rather than on clicking 'Convert'
- Create a reusable converter component that can handle any conversion formula (rather than having the two converters being almost identical)
- Use react-router to replace the tab switching logic (strongly recommended!)
