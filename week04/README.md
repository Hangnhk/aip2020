# Notes

Three Angular projects based on this week's lab exercises and starting from a `ng new` project.

- *basic*: the basic game (plus some unit tests)
- *extras*: the service, as well as history in separate components
- *converter*: last week's project converted into Angular (this was created by Le Kang. thanks Le!)

Important: There are no comments in these examples, but they are expected in this subject.

# Other ideas...

- Add comments!
- Convert the service to communicate with the server
